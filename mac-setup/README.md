# Mac Setup
> Helpful tips for setting up Mac OSX for development.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:L1fescape/slides.git
```

## Run the slides

Any web server like Apache or Nginx will do.

A server run from command line might be easier. Here's what I use:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This will start a basic http server in the current directory running on port 8000.
